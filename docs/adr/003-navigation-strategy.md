# ADR - Navigation Strategy
**Status:** Proposed  

## Context
An effective navigation system is vital for user experience, facilitating movement through different app sections and retaining users.

## Decision
We will implement Bottom Navigation for the application.

## Rationale
- **Usability:** Bottom navigation provides easy access to core sections like Home, Search, and Library.
- **Visibility:** The navigation bar remains visible, offering consistent access to primary sections.
- **User Familiarity:** Bottom navigation is commonly used in music apps, reducing the learning curve.

### Pros:
- **Accessibility:** One-handed use enhances usability on mobile devices.
- **Clear Structure:** Key application features are always displayed.

### Challenges:
- **Limited Space:** The bottom navigation bar can only accommodate a few main sections.
- **Custom Design:** Custom tabs for Spotify branding may require additional styling.
