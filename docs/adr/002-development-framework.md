# ADR - Development Framework
**Status:** Proposed  

## Context
The right development framework is critical for building a high-performance Spotify clone. It must be compatible with Android and align with our team's skill set.

## Decision
We will use React Native as our development framework.

## Rationale
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** React Native supports both Android and potentially iOS, broadening our audience.
- **Performance:** React Native delivers strong performance for media-heavy applications.
- **Team Experience:** Our current learning of React Native aligns with our curriculum, easing the learning curve.
- **Community and Resources:** An extensive library ecosystem provides solutions for complex features.

### Pros:
- **Streamlined Development:** A shared codebase reduces time and effort for platform-specific features.
- **Flexibility:** The modularity of React Native eases third-party library integration.

### Challenges:
- **Native Code:** Certain features may require platform-specific code.
- **Fast Updates:** React Native's rapid updates necessitate ongoing maintenance.
